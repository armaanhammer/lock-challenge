# lock-challenge

This repo is designed to be viewed on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/armaanhammer/lock-challenge). It makes use of some GitHub-specific Markdown, and has Doxygen pages hosted through GitHub.io. Please begin browsing from this page.

My goals in completing this challenge are:
* To generate useful code
* To create documentation I would like to reference.
* To log my process throughout in a way that is useful and that demonstrates how I solve problems.
