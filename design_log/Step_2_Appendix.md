# Step 2 Appendix

## Intial Prompt

> 2) Implement c++11 threading example

>     2-3 threads running

### Parsing prompt:

Uncertain what "threading example" means. Perhaps refering to an included document? Perhaps means to create my own toy example to test class from [Step 1](Step_1.md). If so, then [Step 3](Step_3.md) is meat of what this is getting at, so going to parse through that first and come back to this.
